# custom-loadouts
A weapon management Lua for Stand

---

Tired of having to manually equip every weapon you need on every session you join or having to buy them completely in the end?
**Now there's a solution**.   

---

### What can I do with the Script?
With this Script you'll be able to save all of your currently equipped weapons (together with the ones that you gave to yourself without buying them)   
and to automatically equip them when you join a new session.   
On top of it, you can even manage the weapons and attachments you want, to have it all at one location, to make things easier.

### How to use the script
once loaded, 
1. equip every weapon you need and mount the attachments you want to have
2. hit *Save Loadout* to save your current weapons
3. if you want to automatically load the weapons when joining a new session, tick :ballot_box_with_check:auto-load   
   note that you can still load your loadout manually with the *Load Loadout* option
